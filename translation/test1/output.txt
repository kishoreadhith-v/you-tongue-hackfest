 Hello everyone, today we are going to see multiplication of 2 x 2 matrix how to solve this easily so AB is given by 2 matrix so we are going to solve this easily AB is equal to we have to see row 2 1 so row is 2 1 so we have to write it in row wise 2 1 2 1 next we have 1 3 1 3 1 3 now check the column column is on this side so we have 2 1 we have to write this 2 1 in row wise so 2 1 add 2 and 2 same like this add 2 here add this 1 here now we have to write this 2 1 so we have to write it in row wise so add 2 here add 1 here next we have to write this 0 3 same like this add 0 here add 3 here add 0 here add 3 here next so this is 2 x 2 matrix this is 2 x 2 matrix so Laravel answer is 2 x 2 matrix so this is 2 x 2 matrix so this is 2 x 2 matrix 1 3 2 3 x 1 3 0 9 now we have to write 2 x 2 matrix so so this is plus in the middle this is plus here this is plus here so now we have to write answer 5 3 5 9 this is the answer thank you
