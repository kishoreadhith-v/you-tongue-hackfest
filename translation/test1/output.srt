 Hello everyone, today we are going to see

2
00:00:02,082 --> 00:00:05,008
 multiplication of 2 x 2 matrix

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,082
 how to solve this easily

4
00:00:07,082 --> 00:00:13,002
 so AB is given by 2 matrix

5
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:15,068
 so we are going to solve this easily

6
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:17,080
 AB is equal to

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,054
 we have to see row

8
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:20,050
 2 1

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,054
 so row is 2 1

10
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:24,008
 so we have to write it in row wise

11
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:26,052
 2 1 2 1

12
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:28,064
 next we have

13
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,002
 1 3

14
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:33,072
 1 3 1 3

15
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:36,038
 now check the column

16
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:38,022
 column is on this side

17
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,076
 so we have 2 1

18
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:43,008
 we have to write this 2 1 in row wise

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,062
 so 2 1

20
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:46,014
 add 2 and 2

21
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:47,008
 same like this

22
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,054
 add 2 here

23
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:50,074
 add this 1 here

24
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:52,066
 now we have to write this 2 1

25
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:56,068
 so we have to write it in row wise

26
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:58,014
 so add 2 here

27
00:00:58,014 --> 00:00:59,062
 add 1 here

28
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,028
 next we have to write this 0 3

29
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,098
 same like this

30
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:04,076
 add 0 here

31
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:06,096
 add 3 here

32
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:08,074
 add 0 here

33
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:10,004
 add 3 here

34
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,002
 next

35
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:16,032
 so this is 2 x 2 matrix

36
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,022
 this is 2 x 2 matrix

37
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:20,052
 so Laravel answer is

38
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,064
 2 x 2 matrix

39
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:26,022
 so this is 2 x 2 matrix

40
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:28,096
 so this is 2 x 2 matrix

41
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:28,096


42
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:28,096


43
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,096
 1 3

44
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:33,078
 2 3 x 1

45
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,006
 3 0 9

46
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:39,034
 now we have to write 2 x 2 matrix

47
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:40,020
 so

48
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,022
 so this is plus in the middle

49
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:42,080
 this is plus here

50
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,066
 this is plus here

51
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,082
 so now we have to write answer

52
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:50,070
 5 3

53
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,018
 5 9

54
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:55,054
 this is the answer

55
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:56,088
 thank you
