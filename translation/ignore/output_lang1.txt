 France CFA, you have always defended it, Beck et Ongle, do you continue to do so or do you think that perhaps things need to be changed without going into too much technical details? Mr Perelman, I will simply tell you that there is really nonsense in this debate. I don't want to lack modesty but I was director of the central bank's studies, I was vice-governor, I was governor of the central bank, so I can tell you that I know what I am talking about. France CFA is our currency, it is the currency of the member states and we have accepted it, we have developed it, we have modified it. I was there when the reform took place in the years 1973-74, so all this debate is nonsense. Now it is our currency. I have supervised the financial and monetary management of more than 120 countries around the world. When I was at the International Monetary Fund, I was well placed to say that if this currency is a problem for us, we will listen to the other heads of state and we will make the decisions, but this currency is solid, it is appropriate. Growth rates are among the highest on the African continent and even in the world. The Ivory Coast is among the ten countries where growth rates are the highest. So it is simply a nonsense of demagogy and I do not even want to continue this debate on France CFA. It is the currency of the African countries that have freely agreed and accepted to join forces. Of course, each of us could have had our currency, but what would be the interest? Why did the Europeans decide to have a common currency and we Africans will not be able to do so? We are very proud of this currency. It works well. If there are adaptations to be made, we will do so in a sovereign way.
