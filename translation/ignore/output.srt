8.82 --> 15.44
 Today we are going to see the topic of chatbot. I have already provided an introduction video on what is chatbot.

3
16.40 --> 25.68
 You can watch that video in the playlist link. I have given the link separately. If you watch the introduction video, you will know what chatbot is.

4
25.68 --> 29.96
 Now we are going to see a practical kickstart of chatbot.

5
30.78 --> 34.60
 We are going to see how the chatbot responds to our voice.

6
34.60 --> 39.00
 I am not going to do voice. I will upload videos in the future.

7
39.82 --> 43.50
 Let's see this in Python.

8
43.70 --> 51.74
 In Python, chatbot is already available. You have to install it.

9
51.74 --> 55.84
 If you are using Python terminal, use pip command and install it.

10
56.06 --> 60.80
 If you want to install it in PyCharm, go to settings in the file.

 Click on project interpreter and click on the plus symbol.

12
67.82 --> 70.12
 If you want to install it, go to the top and click on chatbot.

13
71.64 --> 76.82
 I am already installing it. Click on install package and it will be installed.

14
77.30 --> 79.98
 You can do the same thing in other packages.

15
80.60 --> 85.24
 Now we are going to see the code. It is a simple code.

16
96.32 --> 104.28
 In import, you have to import from chatbot.rains import list trainer and from chatbot import chatbot.

17
106.40 --> 109.86

19
118.86 --> 120.52
 I have written a file for the chatbot.

20
120.52 --> 128.88
 I have written a file for the chatbot.

21
130.70 --> 134.92
 I am going to show you that file.

22
136.18 --> 139.32
 This is the predefined statement.

23
139.80 --> 146.00
 This is the advanced level.

24
146.00 --> 147.56

25
148.70 --> 153.64

 Traditionally, chatbot works in voice and text.

32
179.50 --> 183.56
