 Hi, welcome to A2Zknowledge.com. This video is in language Tamil. If you want the same video in English, you can find the link in the description box of this video. Today we are going to see the topic of chatbot. I have already provided an introduction video on what is chatbot. You can watch that video in the playlist link. I have given the link separately. If you watch the introduction video, you will know what chatbot is. Now we are going to see a practical kickstart of chatbot. We are going to see how the chatbot responds to our voice. I am not going to do voice. I will upload videos in the future. Let's see this in Python. In Python, chatbot is already available. You have to install it. If you are using Python terminal, use pip command and install it. If you want to install it in PyCharm, go to settings in the file. Click on project interpreter and click on the plus symbol. If you want to install it, go to the top and click on chatbot. I am already installing it. Click on install package and it will be installed. You can do the same thing in other packages. Now we are going to see the code. It is a simple code. In import, you have to import from chatbot.rains import list trainer and from chatbot import chatbot. After importing, I have written some code. I have written a name for chatbot. I have written a file for the chatbot. I have written a file for the chatbot. I am going to show you that file. This is the predefined statement. This is the advanced level. I will upload the upcoming videos. If you receive the predefined content, it will give you the response. If you enter in this order, it will give you the response. You can also do this in the chatbot library. I have given this as a file. It will read the response and match the response. You can do this in the chatbot. Traditionally, chatbot works in voice and text. Today, many modern algorithms work in Google assist. I will show you a demo. I have given the conversation.
